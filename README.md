Design and prototype a secure realtime notification system

We would like to be able to push information to user's browsers, instead of having the users poll the backend for new data periodically. Please build a proof of concept application on Heroku using Django and the Pusher add-on. The application should utilize private channels to propagate changes to users in realtime securely. One possible multi-user real-time app idea is a simple chat room, or a shared todo list.

Please also brainstorm and come up with a good strategy for how individual developers in a team can rely on the Pusher realtime system even when developing locally.

Please also think about how you would be able to build a real time notification system like Pusher.
